Create a web page with the following HTML elements:

A header
A sub-header
An image
A hyperlink to another page
A paragraph

Want a challenge?

Add an ordered list (ol) and an unordered list (ul) containing three separate list elements to your web page.
When you are done, upload screenshots of your code and your page displayed in the browser.

Stuck? Go to MDN (Links to an external site.) to find the proper tags for each HTML element.

Need some dummy text to fill your paragraphs or headers? Check out lorem ipsum (Links to an external site.), a common text placeholder used when designing websites.
